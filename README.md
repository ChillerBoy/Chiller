# Chiller
Cleaned and reorganized on 2025-09-08.

## Layout
- `ChillerCode.ino` — main Arduino sketch (keep this at repo root).
- `src/` — all C++ sources and headers.
- `docs/` — documentation (design notes, sequence of operations).

## Build
Open `ChillerCode.ino` in Arduino IDE or compile with arduino-cli. 
Includes are relative (e.g. `#include "MyHeader.h"`). No code paths changed.
